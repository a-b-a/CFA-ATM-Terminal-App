# CFA-ATM-Terminal-App
A Simple ATM application created in Ruby during the CoderFatoryAcademy Fast Track course.

The task was to emulate an ATM, where the user could deposit or withdraw money depending on their input, and if the user has enough balance.. The ATM also has a balance, and money cannot be retrieved when there are no more funds in the ATM.
